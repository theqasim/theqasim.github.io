            <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__faster">
                I am a developer and a media creator. This website was built to showcase my work and you can learn more about myself too. You will find everything from past coding projects, my current roles within companies I work for, companies I own & media content
                I have created. I have had a passion for technology for as long as I can remember, I would fantasize about what the future could look like and how I could develop my skills to be part of it in an impactful way. This passion for technology
                has remained within me for my entire life and it will never fade.</p>
            <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp ">Content creation has been my main focus for many years, however, in last year or so I dedicated more of my time to coding in the hopes of making that my main focus. I am currently studying Computer Science at university in Manchester, UK</p>
